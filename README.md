# Ansible-Playbooks
n Ansible playbook is a configuration management and orchestration tool used to automate deployment, configuration, and management of infrastructure and applications. It allows you to define a set of tasks and roles that can be executed on remote hosts, ensuring consistent and repeatable setups.

Here's a breakdown of key components and concepts related to Ansible playbooks:

## Playbook Structure:

A playbook is a YAML file that contains a list of plays.
Each play consists of a set of tasks to be executed on a specific group of hosts.

## Hosts and Inventory:

Ansible operates on a group of hosts specified in an inventory file.
The inventory file lists the hosts and organizes them into groups.

## Tasks:

A task is a single unit of work to be performed on a target host.
Tasks are written using YAML syntax and describe a specific action, such as installing a package, copying a file, or restarting a service.

## Roles:

Roles provide a way to organize and package related tasks, handlers, variables, and files into a reusable structure.
Roles can be used across multiple playbooks, making it easier to manage and share configuration logic.

## Variables:

Variables can be used to parameterize your playbooks and make them more flexible.
Variables can be defined at various levels, including play level, host level, or in separate variable files.

## Handlers:

Handlers are tasks that get triggered by other tasks. They are typically used to restart services or perform similar actions only when needed.
Handlers are defined separately and then notified by tasks when necessary.
