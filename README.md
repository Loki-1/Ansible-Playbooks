# Ansible-Playbooks
n Ansible playbook is a configuration management and orchestration tool used to automate deployment, configuration, and management of infrastructure and applications. It allows you to define a set of tasks and roles that can be executed on remote hosts, ensuring consistent and repeatable setups.

Here's a breakdown of key components and concepts related to Ansible playbooks:

## Playbook Structure:

A playbook is a YAML file that contains a list of plays.
Each play consists of a set of tasks to be executed on a specific group of hosts.

## Hosts and Inventory:

Ansible operates on a group of hosts specified in an inventory file.
The inventory file lists the hosts and organizes them into groups.

Tasks:

A task is a single unit of work to be performed on a target host.
Tasks are written using YAML syntax and describe a specific action, such as installing a package, copying a file, or restarting a service.
Roles:

Roles provide a way to organize and package related tasks, handlers, variables, and files into a reusable structure.
Roles can be used across multiple playbooks, making it easier to manage and share configuration logic.
